Drawing from my studies in Multimedia, Web Technologies, and Communication at the University of Aveiro, I've always been excited by the crossroads of technology and design. Whether it's perfecting the balance between UI/UX for optimal user experiences or leveraging advanced web development techniques to create responsive and intuitive platforms, I thrive at that intersection. While I'm deeply immersed in a current project, I'm always open to networking and potential collaborationsâ€”feel free to reach out!
