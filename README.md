I am a Master's student in Communication and Web Technologies with a passion for technological innovation, sustainability, and human-computer interaction.

My skills include web development, UI/UX design, and multimedia, with proficiency in languages such as JavaScript, React, React Native, and SQL. I have experience working with CI/CD pipelines and am always eager to learn and expand my knowledge in this rapidly-evolving field.

I am dedicated to creating meaningful and impactful work that pushes the boundaries of what is possible with technology.
